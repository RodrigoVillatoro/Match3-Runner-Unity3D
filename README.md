# Match3-Runner-Unity3D
Game Prototype: a combination of a match 3 game and endless runner, made in Unity3d and C#.

### Game Description:
A character is running endlessly on a plane. It has to catch as many gems as possible by matching 3 of the same color. The gems are collected by colliding with them. When the 'gem basket' is full (i.e. the player has collected a lot of gems without making many matches), the game ends.

###### The logic for the match 3 engine came mostly from these tutorials:

- https://youtu.be/7uF3NSfsCAY (It's in Portuguese, I know, but the code is self explanatory).
